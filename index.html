          <h2>PDF Alignment Tool</h2>
          <p>
            This tool allows you to shift the content of pages within a PDF
            document. This is particularly useful for correcting alignment
            issues before printing.

          <h2>Card Layout Tool</h2>
          <p>
            This tool helps you arrange images into a grid layout on standard
            page sizes (A4, Letter) for printing game cards. It supports duplex
            printing by allowing separate image sets for fronts and backs.
